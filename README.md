# Project---Student-Analytical-Dashboard**
Student Analytical Dashboard**

Focussing on core concepts in Learning Analytical Dashboards or LADs, this project aims to utilise Web 3 frameworks to comprehensively be the first of its kind, and implement an actual dashboard for students who struggle on a regular basis 
to progress and skill up during their student lives in school or university.

With a primarily narrow focus on university students , who are sitting for placements in the near future, this application
implements a reminder, journal and resources system , each of which aid the user in achieving their overall goal of skilling up!

The project, admittedly is in its infancy, with a few bugs, but the future scope of the project can include deep learning models to optimise the resources sections, to scrape the web for resources in the user's favoured domains. Further, more skills that are non Computer Science related can also be included to ensure holistic development of the student!
